These binaries are compiled against .NET Framework 4.5.0 (as opposed to the .NET Framework 2.0). The .NET Framework 4.5 provides more and improved functionalities, however it is not included by default in older versions of Microsoft Windows [1]. See the Notes column of the Cheatsheet for info on which additional cmdlets are supported [2].

In NoPowerShell v1.23 the Compress-Archive and Expand-Archive cmdlets require .NET 4.5+.
